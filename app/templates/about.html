    <h1>Our Story</h1>
    <p>Reinsurance Analytics is on a mission to revolutionize treaty structuring and risk management with modern AI.</p>

    <h2>Why We Started</h2>
    <p>
      Reinsurance treaty design is still largely manual, opaque, and expensive. As actuaries and data scientists, we saw an opportunity to change that.
      Drawing from our experience in pricing optimization and financial risk modeling, we built an AI co-pilot that combines Reinforcement Learning with cutting-edge Language Models to guide underwriters toward optimal treaty terms—quickly, transparently, and with confidence.

    <h2>Our Vision</h2>
    <p>
      We believe intelligent treaty structuring should be accessible to all reinsurers—not just the largest firms. Our goal is to democratize advanced reinsurance analytics by creating tools that are:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Interpretable:</strong> Easy to explain, easy to trust</li>
      <li><strong>Efficient:</strong> Automating hours of analysis and iteration</li>
      <li><strong>Interactive:</strong> Powered by natural language queries</li>
    </ul>
