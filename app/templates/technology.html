    <p>
      ReAnalytics combines cutting-edge Reinforcement Learning (RL) with advanced Large Language Models (LLMs) to assist underwriters in structuring and optimizing reinsurance treaties. Our hybrid stack enables both quantitative optimization and natural language understanding—empowering smarter, faster decisions.

        <h3>📄 LLM (Mistral)</h3>
        <p>
          Reads and summarizes complex treaty documents, cedent submissions, and loss histories. Enables interactive Q&A—“What happens if we change the limit to $20M?”—and provides contextual explanations of reinsurance terms and impacts.

        <h3>🎯 PPO Reinforcement Learning</h3>
        <p>
          Trains an agent using simulated claims to recommend optimal treaty parameters such as retention and limit. The agent learns by exploring scenarios and optimizing for profitability, solvency, or client-specific goals.
